# frontendchallenge-tailwindcss
This is a frontend challenge I undetook in the frontendmentor.io challenges.
The challenge was to create a landing page for a company called Manage.
The website is fully responsive and good measures were taken to enable multi-device functionality.
The website has tailwindcss, html and a bit of javascript to toggle menu on small screens.
